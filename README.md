# The Basket Theme

The **Basket** Theme is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). This README.md file should be modified to describe the features, installation, configuration, and general usage of this theme.

## Description

Grav theme based on wonderful [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/) framework, hand-crafted so that you could enjoy this unique CSS library!

## Status
Theme is still rather a proof of concept than usable component, so please, be patient, it will be developed further ;)

### :warning: Please, mind:
>**This theme does not comply with some styling manners used by most Grav theme developers.** Because of that it's likely that it wont be compatible with most of the other themes and possibly some plugins. You have been warned.
